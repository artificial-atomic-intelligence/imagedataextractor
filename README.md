# imagedataextractor 2.0

**imagedataextractor** is a Python library for electron microscopy image quantification.

## Features

- Automatic detection and download of microscopy images from scientific articles.
- Particle segmentation with uncertainty quantification.
- Particle localization.
- Automatic scalebar detection (reading and measurement).
- Particle size distributions.
- Obtain locations, sizes and aspect ratios of all particles in an image (in the form of a .csv file).
- Radial distribution functions of extracted particle systems.

## Installation

```bash
pip install imagedataextractor
```
